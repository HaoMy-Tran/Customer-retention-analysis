### Customer Analysis – How X Can Leverage "Money Cashback" to Increase Customer Retention for Long-Term Growth?

### Project Overview

Two years ago, I completed a project called 'Case-study-1' for a digital wallet (referred to as "X"), where I focused on analyzing customer retention and providing key insights. During this initial project, I achieved the following:

- Processed data using Python and Excel to extract the necessary indicators.
- Built a dashboard to visualize the results and track customer retention over time.

However, there were several limitations to this approach:

- Certain stages of the data processing were manual, introducing inefficiencies.
- The project lacked a clear marketing strategy or actionable insights, as I didn’t propose a detailed plan for the marketing team.
- The data processing method was inflexible—any small changes required a complete overhaul of the approach, and it wasn’t easily adaptable for exploring other aspects of the data.

With over 1.5 years of experience working in the insights area, I revisited the project with a fresh perspective and a more refined approach. This time, I used Power BI to create a more flexible, interactive, and insightful dashboard. Here’s what I achieved in the updated version:

- Conducted deeper analysis into the dataset, providing actionable insights and recommendations to help reduce operational costs, retain and attract more customer retention, and identify relevant areas for further analysis.
- Developed an interactive dashboard with key indicators that the marketing team can use for their decision-making.
- Ensured consistency in results by achieving the same accuracy level across three different approaches (Power BI, Excel, Python).
- Introduced a static PowerPoint report to effectively communicate findings and present a cohesive, data-driven story.

This updated project incorporates lessons learned from my previous work and experience, offering a more scalable, insightful, and actionable solution for the marketing team.

#### What I Learned Through This Project

- A small indicator or finding can tell an entirely different story when placed in a different context.
- Data analysis isn't just about building "fancy" models. The choice of model depends on how familiar you are with its application and interpretation, as well as the responsibility you have for the findings and recommendations you make.

### Project Reading Instructions:

#### Power BI File (.pbix)

- **'Dashboard'**: Includes all the key indicators that the marketing team needs for their purposes.
- **'Cohort Analysis (Newly Added)'**: Provides a broader view of customer retention and opens the door for further exploration of other aspects of the data.
- **'Season Analysis'**: Analyzes customer retention trends across three customer segments, identifying peak seasons for customer retention and the service groups that are most worth investing in.
- **'RFM Segmentation'**: Displays the results of RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) segmentation using the percentile method. You can view the underlying code by checking the treemap.
- **'Spending Analysis'**: Analyzes spending patterns to find ways to reduce cashback costs, focusing on the share of costs for each service and how the spending of each service correlates with total spending.
- **'Spending Frequency Analysis'**: Similar to the 'Spending Analysis,' this focuses on transaction frequency to understand its role in customer retention.
- **'CVS Spending Share'**: After identifying the potential to reduce CVS-related costs, this analysis examines CVS spending trends over time and determines which customer segments should have their cashback rates adjusted.

#### PowerPoint (ppix)

- Tells the story throughout this analysis, outlining the context, recommended actions, and the achievements of this project.

#### Excel (xlsx)

- Includes the requirements and raw data.


After all, my project may have several limitations that I may not have identified. Therefore, your recommendations for my project are greatly appreciated! Feel free to submit a pull request or contact me at myhao14159@gmail.com for further discussions and feedback.
