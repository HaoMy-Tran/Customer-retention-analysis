# Customer-retention-analysis
# Project Overview

Two years ago, I completed a project called 'Case-study-1' for a digital wallet (referred to as "X"), where I focused on analyzing customer retention and providing key insights. During this initial project, I achieved the following:

- Processed data using both Python and Excel to extract the required indicators.
- Built a dashboard to visualize the results and track customer retention over time.

However, there were several limitations to this approach:

- Certain stages of the data processing were manual, which introduced inefficiencies.
- The project lacked a clear marketing strategy or actionable insights, as I didn’t propose a detailed plan for the marketing team.
- The data processing method was inflexible—any small changes required a complete overhaul of the approach, and it wasn’t easily adaptable for exploring other aspects of the data.

With over 1.5 years of experience working in the insights area, I revisited the project with a fresh perspective and a more refined approach. This time, I used Power BI to create a more flexible, interactive, and insightful dashboard. Here’s what I achieved in the updated version:

- Developed an interactive dashboard with key indicators that marketing teams can use for their decision-making.
- Conducted deeper analysis into the dataset, providing actionable insights and recommendations for future strategies.
- Built a static PowerPoint report to effectively communicate the findings and tell a cohesive, data-driven story.

This updated project incorporates lessons learned from my previous work and experience, offering a more scalable, insightful, and actionable solution for the marketing team.
