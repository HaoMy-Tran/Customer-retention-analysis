-- As I have mentioned the the .pbix (Power BI) file, the trick for this is: for any case where a user can achieve DIAMOND status for 20 days, there are always 9 specific dates that must be included (from March 12 to March 20). That means, for a user to be eligible to win, they must first achieve DIAMOND status from March 12 to March 20â€”this is the necessary condition to win. This time, with SQL approach, I will primarily filter the users whose transactions can be eligile from 12 to 20 Mar, meaning this is the necessary condition to become the winners.
